Spatial Statistics

Spatial data are becoming increasingly available in a wide range of disciplines, including social sciences such as political science and criminology, as well as sciences such as geosciences and ecology. This course will introduce methods for exploring and analyzing spatial data. We will cover methods to describe and analyze three main types of spatial data: areal, point process, and point-referenced (geostatistical) data. We will also introduce tools for working with spatial data in R.

Prerequisites: Any introductory statistics course at Wellesley (BISC 198, ECON 103/SOC 190, STAT 160, STAT 218, or POL 299) or permission of instructor.
